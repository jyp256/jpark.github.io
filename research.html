				Good public policy in a democracy relies on efficient and accurate information flows between individuals
				with firsthand, substantive expertise and elected legislators. While legislators are tasked with the job
				of making and passing policy, they are politicians and not substantive experts. To make well-informed
				policy, they must rely on the expertise of others. Hearings on the Hill argues that partisanship and
				close competition for control of government shape the information that legislators collect, providing
				opportunities for party leaders and interest groups to control information flows and influence policy.
				It reveals how legislators strategically use committees, a central institution of Congress, and their
				hearings for information acquisition and dissemination, ultimately impacting policy development in
				American democracy. Marshaling extensive new data on hearings and witnesses from 1960 to 2018, this book
				offers the first comprehensive analysis of how partisan incentives determine how and from whom members

				Congress often relies on bureaucrats’ information for policy production. However,scholars lack an
				empirical understanding of what drives information sharing between bureaucrats and legislators. We argue
				that the partisan alignment between a bureaucrat and legislator determines the amount and type of
				information transmitted. Using new comprehensive data on bureaucratic witnesses in committee hearings,
				as well as a new measure of the informational content of testimonies, we show that less analytical
				information is transmitted between a bureaucrat and legislator pair when the legislator is a
				presidential out-partisan than a co-partisan, and that this effect is heightened when the bureaucrat is
				a political appointee. At the aggregate hearing level, the collective amount of analytical information
				from bureaucrats is lower under divided government than unified government but is offset by the
				analytical information from non-bureaucratic witnesses. These dynamics provide a nuanced understanding
				of the information transmission between bureaucrats and Congress.

				we release a language model that can identify the topic being argued in a sentence, be it implicit or

			<div class="panel-body">
				Theoretical expectations regarding communication patterns between legislators and outside agents, such
				as lobbyists, agency officials, or policy experts, often depend on the relationship between legislators’
				and agents’ preferences. However, legislators and nonelected outside agents evaluate the merits of
				policies using distinct criteria and considerations. We develop a measurement method that flexibly
				estimates the policy preferences for a class of outside agents—witnesses in committee hearings—separate
				from that of legislators’ and compute their preference distance across the two dimensions. In our
				application to Medicare hearings, we find that legislators in the U.S. Congress heavily condition their
				questioning of witnesses on preference distance, showing that legislators tend to seek policy
				information from like-minded experts in committee hearings. We do not find this result using a
				conventional measurement placing both actors on one dimension. The contrast in results lends support for

			<div class="panel-body">
				Several theories of policy change posit that the politics of defining and prioritizing problems differs
				from the politics of devising and selecting solutions. The former involves simplifying through
				heuristics like indicators and ideology while the latter incorporates policy analysis and expertise to a
				greater degree. By employing two large datasets of U.S. congressional hearings to analyze policymakers'
				behavior of sending political messages, which we call “grandstanding,” we offer two findings. First,
				consistent with our hypotheses, grandstanding is more prevalent when committees are focused on new and
				emerging problems than when committees examine proposed alternatives or the implementation of existing
				policies. Second, the cognitive dynamics of problem solving and the incentives to grandstand vary
				depending on policy issues considered in hearings. Our analysis helps put dissatisfaction with
				contemporary U.S. policymaking in context: a rise in “messaging politics” derives at least in part from
				an increased focus on contesting the problem space in agenda-setting venues.

				This paper makes an empirical contribution to this lingering question by conducting extensive tests on
				whether this asymmetry hypothesis is a cross-nationally generalizable phenomenon using all currently

				representative democracies between 1996 and 2016, as well as macro-economic indicators and

				Morality shapes politics by defining right and wrong, but its instinctive appeal---often bypassing deliberation---
				can exacerbate partisan hostility and echo chambers. Despite this significance, little is known about the extent to 
				which politics is moralized and the conditions associated with it. Analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 3.3 million 
				U.S. Congressional tweets from 2013 to 2022, we find a striking, decade-long rise in moral rhetoric. Regression analyses 
				show that members' use of moral rhetoric is closely tied to electoral incentives to mobilize co-partisans: members use 
				moral rhetoric---especially negative---more as elections near, during low-turnout midterms, and in more homogeneous 
				districts heavily composed of co-partisans. Furthermore, we find that, over time, the election–moralization link has

				The increasing influence of China in both international and domestic contexts has emerged as a central consideration for U.S. policymakers. 
				Despite this, there remains a limited understanding of how China is portrayed by U.S. policymakers.

				from engagement to containment. Moreover, we also find more nuanced partisan differences in topical focus and the tone which may contradict

				semantic-positional dissonance. Embedding models must distinguish between arguments sharing similar linguistic 
				characteristics yet advancing opposing positions, and conversely recognizing when diverse linguistic expression 
				across different cultural, societal, and philosophical contexts convey identical positions. This distinction 
				between content, rhetoric, and position is a complex issue that requires insight from both cognitive science 
				and computational social science. To address this challenge, we introduce ArguBias, a framework that systematically 
				identifies, evaluates, and improves similarity judgments for arguments containing cognitive bias structures. 
				First, we establish the ArguBias corpus, containing 8,000 annotated argument pairs facilitating the taxonomy 
				of previously unexamined cognitive bias structures in argumentation. Second, we conduct an extensive evaluation 
				of 10 state-of-the-art embedding models on their cognitive bias sensitivity. We find general-purpose text embedding 
				models struggle significantly with lexical overlap and confirmation bias when judging argument similarity. 
				Third, we demonstrate how minimally fine-tuning embedding models with the ArguBias corpus reduces their sensitivity 
				to cognitive bias structures by up to 11.6pp, and we show that this improvement carries over to other argument similarity benchmarks.

				<br>With Myunghoon Kang.<br>Under review.</button></div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				Voters learn the quality of the incumbent party through its policy outcomes. Previous studies mostly focused 
				on the incumbent’s strategy to make the policy outcome informative largely ignoring the role of the challenger. 
				We develop an agency model with two innovative features: both the incumbent and the challenger party can contribute 
				to the informativeness of the policy outcome, and each party can allocate its resources between revealing information 
				and improving its quality directly. We find that only the disadvantaged party is willing to invest in information revelation, 
				but it does so only if the quality gap between the two parties is sufficiently large. Unlike the conventional wisdom, 
				this finding suggests that a weak competition, instead of a close one, helps the voter make a better-informed decision.

				of Representation using an Argument Extraction Method</b>
				<br>With Arman Irani, Kevin Esterling, and Michalis Faloutsos<br></button></div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				In representative democracy, it is crucial to include the perspectives of those governed in policy
				making. To analyze representation, research often links public policy preferences with legislators’
				stances through surveys and votes. However, the scholarship lacks effective methods to gauge if
				substantive policy ideas of the public gain lawmakers’ attention. This study combines Reddit discussions
				on policy issues with U.S. House of Representatives’ hearing transcripts from 2005-2022 to develop an
				innovative LLM-driven argument detection and stance classification framework called WIBA (“What is
				Being Argued”). By applying WIBA, we visualize the overlap of arguments, identifying which communities
				of interest are represented or overlooked in legislative deliberations and how the pattern of
				representation varies across partisan and non-partisan policy issues. Our proposed approach shifts the
				focus from organized interests to the arguments themselves, providing a deeper understanding of
				democratic representation at the argument level.

				<br>With Sean Theriault.</button></div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				Legislators sometimes make impressive political statements in an effort to create a viral moment. Each time one of them succeeds, 
				the incentive to make such statements grows stronger. A recent study analyzing representatives’ speaking patterns during 
				committee hearings show that they tend to engage in such messaging activities when they have less legislative power to move 
				their bills forward to compensate for their lack of legislative achievements and still gain voters’ support (Park 2021).
				We develop a measure of senator grandstanding by analyzing senators’ speaking patterns in committee hearings from the 
				105th to 117th Congresses. We find that grandstanding is more common among minority members, which is consistent with 
				the previous findings from the House, but this effect of being in the minority party is larger in the Senate than in the House. 
				Findings also suggest that senators, on average, tend to grandstand more than representatives.

				<br>With Mitchell Bosley and Kevin Esterling.</button></div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				Whether congressional committees engage in genuine deliberation or mere position-taking—a question long debated 
				in the literature—has fundamental implications for democratic theory and institutional design. Yet empirical tests 
				of these competing theories have been limited by the absence of scalable methods to trace influence from testimony 
				to bill text. To address this gap, we develop a computational approach that combines mechanical text processing with 
				theory-driven AI analysis to identify plausible pathways through which testimony influences legislative changes. 
				Our method first classifies changes by type (substantive-technical, substantive-political, organizational-structural, 
				or symbolicexpressive), then measures influence along three dimensions (temporal uniqueness, marginal contribution, 
				and correspondence strength) while identifying specific mechanisms through which testimony may shape legislation (direct language, 
				technical details, problem framing, solution approach, or conceptual framework). Applied to a proof-of-concept analysis 
				of nuclear waste policy legislation where most changes were substantive-technical, the methodology reveals that these 
				technical provisions show testimony influence while organizational-structural changes do not, with problem framing emerging 
				as the dominant mechanism. The framework generates datasets at three levels of analysis (change-level, speech-change dyad, 
				and speaker-level), enabling researchers to test whether committees function as information-gathering bodies (Krehbiel 1991), 
				venues for position-taking (Mayhew 1974), or forums for genuine deliberation (Habermas 1996).

				<br>With Pamela Ban and Hye Young You.</button></div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				Scientific expertise plays an increasingly central role in policymaking, yet growing distrust toward science among Americans 
				raise questions about how Congress engages with expert witnesses.  Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of 760,000 congressional 
				witnesses from 1961 to 2022 and committee hearing transcripts from 1997 to 2018, we identify those affiliated with universities 
				and think tanks and analyze legislators' interactions with them.  Using the two measures of legislators’ questioning styles---grandstanding
				and analytical engagement---we assess how issue polarization, partisanship, and constituency characteristics shape congressional 
				treatment of expertise. We find that both parties engage in more grandstanding when questioning research witnesses, particularly
				those from think tanks and during hearings on polarized issues.  Republicans consistently exhibit higher grandstanding and lower
				analytical engagement, especially toward university-affiliated scholars. Members representing constituents with lower education
				attainment tend to grandstand more toward researchers. These patterns raise concerns about democratic accountability and effective
				functioning of U.S. Congress.
