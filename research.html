				Good public policy in a democracy relies on efficient and accurate information flows between individuals
				with firsthand, substantive expertise and elected legislators. While legislators are tasked with the job
				of making and passing policy, they are politicians and not substantive experts. To make well-informed
				policy, they must rely on the expertise of others. Hearings on the Hill argues that partisanship and
				close competition for control of government shape the information that legislators collect, providing
				opportunities for party leaders and interest groups to control information flows and influence policy.
				It reveals how legislators strategically use committees, a central institution of Congress, and their
				hearings for information acquisition and dissemination, ultimately impacting policy development in
				American democracy. Marshaling extensive new data on hearings and witnesses from 1960 to 2018, this book
				offers the first comprehensive analysis of how partisan incentives determine how and from whom members
				of Congress seek information.

					Argued? A Comprehensive Approach to Argument Mining</button></div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				We propose WIBA, a novel framework and suite of methods that enable the comprehensive understanding of
				"What Is Being Argued" across contexts. Our approach develops a comprehensive framework that detects:
				(a) the existence, (b) the topic, and (c) the stance of an argument, correctly accounting for the
				logical dependence among the three tasks. Our algorithm leverages the fine-tuning and prompt-engineering
				of Large Language Models. We evaluate our approach and show that it performs well in all the three
				capabilities. First, we develop and release an Argument Detection model that can classify a piece of
				text as an argument with an F1 score between 79% and 86% on three different benchmark datasets. Second,
				we release a language model that can identify the topic being argued in a sentence, be it implicit or
				explicit, with an average similarity score of 71%, outperforming current naive methods by nearly 40%.
				Finally, we develop a method for Argument Stance Classification, and evaluate the capability of our
				approach, showing it achieves a classification F1 score between 71% and 78% across three diverse
				benchmark datasets. Our evaluation demonstrates that WIBA allows the comprehensive understanding of What
				Is Being Argued in large corpora across diverse contexts, which is of core interest to many applications
				in linguistics, communication, and social and computer science. To facilitate accessibility to the
				advancements outlined in this work, we release WIBA as a free open access platform.

			<div class="panel-body">
				Theoretical expectations regarding communication patterns between legislators and outside agents, such
				as lobbyists, agency officials, or policy experts, often depend on the relationship between legislators’
				and agents’ preferences. However, legislators and nonelected outside agents evaluate the merits of
				policies using distinct criteria and considerations. We develop a measurement method that flexibly
				estimates the policy preferences for a class of outside agents—witnesses in committee hearings—separate
				from that of legislators’ and compute their preference distance across the two dimensions. In our
				application to Medicare hearings, we find that legislators in the U.S. Congress heavily condition their
				questioning of witnesses on preference distance, showing that legislators tend to seek policy
				information from like-minded experts in committee hearings. We do not find this result using a
				conventional measurement placing both actors on one dimension. The contrast in results lends support for
				the construct validity of our proposed preference measures.

					Problems versus Solutions: Policymaking and Grandstanding in Congressional Hearings </button></div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				Several theories of policy change posit that the politics of defining and prioritizing problems differs
				from the politics of devising and selecting solutions. The former involves simplifying through
				heuristics like indicators and ideology while the latter incorporates policy analysis and expertise to a
				greater degree. By employing two large datasets of U.S. congressional hearings to analyze policymakers'
				behavior of sending political messages, which we call “grandstanding,” we offer two findings. First,
				consistent with our hypotheses, grandstanding is more prevalent when committees are focused on new and
				emerging problems than when committees examine proposed alternatives or the implementation of existing
				policies. Second, the cognitive dynamics of problem solving and the incentives to grandstand vary
				depending on policy issues considered in hearings. Our analysis helps put dissatisfaction with
				contemporary U.S. policymaking in context: a rise in “messaging politics” derives at least in part from
				an increased focus on contesting the problem space in agenda-setting venues.

				The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2023.
				Members of Congress often use committee hearings as venues for political grandstanding. What we do not
				know is if members who engage in this behavior are electorally rewarded. Using a dataset of 12,820 House
				committee hearing transcripts from the 105th to 114th Congresses, I nd that an increase in a member's
				grandstanding tendency in a given Congress leads to an increased vote share in the following election.
				The effect is stronger when voters are potentially more exposed to grandstanding. To further investigate
				the causal path, I test mechanisms through which voters reward members' grandstanding e orts using the
				Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) panel survey data. The results show that the effect of
				grandstanding tends to work through persuading non-supporters rather than mobilizing turnout of
				supporters. An additional analysis shows that PAC donors and voters react differently to members'
				grandstanding behavior, providing members with incentives to represent these two groups differently.

				evidence shows how certain institutional conditions can affect how much committees turn to outsiders for
				information and from whom they seek information.

				While congressional committee members sometimes hold hearings to collect and transmit specialized
				information to the floor, they also use hearings as venues to send political messages by framing an
				issue or a party to the public which I refer to as “grandstanding.” However, we lack clear understanding
				of when they strategically engage in grandstanding. I argue that when committee members have limited
				legislative power they resort to making grandstanding speeches in hearings to please their target
				audience. Using 12,820 House committee hearing transcripts from the 105th to 114th Congresses and
				employing a crowd-sourced supervised learning method, I measure a “grandstanding score” for each
				statement that committee members make. Findings suggest that grandstanding efforts are made more
				commonly among minority members under a unified government, and non-chair members of powerful
				committees, and in committees with jurisdiction over policies that the president wields primary power,
				such as foreign affairs and national security.

				While US Congress assigns only the members of a majority party to committee chairs, some state

				members of a minority party for the position to promote a bipartisan policy making practice. Although
				previous literature investigates the effects of bipartisan rules and practices exploiting such

				not been explored. By extending a recent study exploring conditions under which information transmission
				from agents to a principal is improved, this research note theoretically examines the effect of the
				committee chair’s majority partisan status on information acquisition and transmission via committee
				hearings. Findings suggest that under some conditions, the floor can informationally benefit more from
				having a chair representing a minority party in the chamber with opposite bias call a hearing than with
				a chair representing a majority party.

			<div class="panel-body">
				It has been controversial whether incumbents are punished more for a bad economy than they are rewarded
				for a good economy due to mixed results from previous studies on one or handful number of countries.
				This paper makes an empirical contribution to this lingering question by conducting extensive tests on
				whether this asymmetry hypothesis is a cross-nationally generalizable phenomenon using all currently
				available modules of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems survey from 122 elections in 42
				representative democracies between 1996 and 2016, as well as macro-economic indicators and

				using certain economic indicators, these conditional effects are largely inconsistent, suggesting that
				it is still safe to assume a linear relationship between economic conditions and support for the

				Congress often relies on bureaucrats’ information for policy production. However,scholars lack an
				empirical understanding of what drives information sharing between bureaucrats and legislators. We argue
				that the partisan alignment between a bureaucrat and legislator determines the amount and type of
				information transmitted. Using new comprehensive data on bureaucratic witnesses in committee hearings,
				as well as a new measure of the informational content of testimonies, we show that less analytical
				information is transmitted between a bureaucrat and legislator pair when the legislator is a
				presidential out-partisan than a co-partisan, and that this effect is heightened when the bureaucrat is
				a political appointee. At the aggregate hearing level, the collective amount of analytical information
				from bureaucrats is lower under divided government than unified government but is offset by the
				analytical information from non-bureaucratic witnesses. These dynamics provide a nuanced understanding
				of the information transmission between bureaucrats and Congress.
